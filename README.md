Yifei Lin and Zhijian Kuang.
this is a Rough idea of the assignment.
We would like to make a drawing robot arm for this project. 
Our background is many customer would like to paint some custom sketches. 
And this robot can draw the sketches for customer. In the program for customer. 
The GUI can provide a drawing board and customer could draw on the board and the robot arm will drawing the sketch when customer press the 'drawing' button. 
The advantage for this design is the robot arm can drawing all material surface such as table, ground and paper.
